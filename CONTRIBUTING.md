# How to Contribute

Welcome to our project! Hereâ€™s how you can contribute.

## Workflow
1. **Open an Issue**  
   - Search [existing Issues](https://github.com/TuringOpsSH/NextConsole/issues) before reporting bugs or suggesting features.  
   - Use the template and provide details (e.g., environment, reproduction steps).  

2. **Develop Code**  
   - Fork the repo and create a branch (name format: `feat/xxx` or `fix/xxx`).  
   - Run tests: `npm test` (ensure all tests pass).  
   - Follow [ESLint rules](/.eslintrc).  

3. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   - Reference related Issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).  
   - Include a clear description and test screenshots.  

## Code of Conduct  
- Adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
