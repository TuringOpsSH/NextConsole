### Quick Start

#### Basic Resource Dependencies
Before starting to use NextConsole, please ensure that your environment meets the following basic resource dependencies:
- **Hardware Configuration**: At least 2 CPU cores and 4GB of memory.
- **Operating System**: Linux system.
- **Browser**: Chrome browser, version 110 or higher.
- **Containerization Tool**: Docker.

#### Operation Steps

##### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open the terminal and use the `cd` command to enter the Docker directory of NextConsole:
```bash
cd next_console/docker
```

##### 2. Configure the Service
Use the `vi` editor to open the configuration file `config/server/config_private.py`:
```bash
vi config/server/config_private.py
```
In the configuration file, you need to make the following configurations:

**Domain Configuration**:
Set the domain name of the application. Here is an example using the local address:
```python
app.config["domain"] = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Configuration**:
It is recommended to use the free embedding and reranking models provided by Siliconflow. The specific configurations are as follows:
```python
# Vector model (It is recommended to use the free embed and rerank models from Siliconflow)
app.config["EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT"] = "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings"
app.config["EMBEDDING_MODEL"] = "BAAI/bge-m3"
app.config["EMBEDDING_KEY"] = ""
app.config["RERANK_ENDPOINT"] = "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/rerank"
app.config["RERANK_MODEL"] = "BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3"
app.config["RERANK_KEY"] = ""
app.config["search_engine_endpoint"] = "https://google.serper.dev/search"
app.config["search_engine_key"] = ""
```
Please fill in the corresponding keys (`EMBEDDING_KEY`, `RERANK_KEY`, `search_engine_key`) according to the actual situation. If you don't have them for now, you can leave them blank.

##### 3. Start the Docker Containers
After the configuration is completed, use the following command to start the Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

##### 4. Access the Services
After the successful startup, you can access the corresponding services through the following addresses:
- **Server Service**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- **Admin Service**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8082`

**Default Login Information**:
- **Username**: `admin@nextconsole.cn`
- **Password**: `next_console`

##### 5. Initial Model Configuration
Log in to the Admin service at port `8082`. Find the "Model Management" function module and configure the corresponding models according to your needs.

##### 6. Start the First Conversation
Log in to the Server service at port `8080`. Click on the "AI Workbench" to start your intelligent experience!

By following the above steps, you can quickly start NextConsole and begin using it! üòÉ
